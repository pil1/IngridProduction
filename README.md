4. **Start frontend development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at:
   - **Frontend**: `http://localhost:8080` (with hot reload)
   - **Backend API**: `http://localhost:3001`

docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down     # Stop backend services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs     # View service logs

# Frontend Development
npm run dev           # Start development server (requires Docker services)
npm run build         # Production build
npm run build:dev     # Development build
npm run preview       # Preview production build

# Code Quality
npm run lint          # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix      # Fix ESLint issues
npm run type-check    # TypeScript type checking

# Testing
npm run test          # Run tests
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report

# Analysis
npm run analyze       # Bundle analysis
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Development Environment
```bash
# Start development environment (PostgreSQL + Redis + Backend with hot reload)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Then start frontend locally for hot reload
npm run dev

# Application available at http://localhost:8080
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Start complete production stack (PostgreSQL + Redis + Backend + Frontend + Nginx)
docker-compose up -d

# Application available at http://localhost (port 80)
```

### Container Management
```bash
# View logs for all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs

# View specific service logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs postgres

# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for Docker builds
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
POSTGRES_DB=infotrac
POSTGRES_USER=infotrac_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=infotrac_password
```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Component-based architecture** with separation of concerns
- **Custom hooks** for business logic and state management
- **Service layer abstraction** for API calls
- **Error boundaries** for graceful error handling
- **Lazy loading** for performance optimization

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Authentication** with secure token-based sessions
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** for database-level data isolation
- **Role-based permissions** with route protection
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with company-based access control

### 🔧 Module System
- **Granular feature control** with module-based activation
- **Three-tier access control**: System → Company → User
- **Super-admin provisioning** for company module access
- **Admin user assignment** for individual module permissions
- **Dynamic menu visibility** based on module access
- **Core vs Add-on modules** with different activation rules
- See `MODULE_ACTIVATION_SYSTEM.md` for detailed documentation
